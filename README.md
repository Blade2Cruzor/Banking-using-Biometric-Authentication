# Description📝
This Repo contains a web application on <b>BANKING<b><br/>
Users create profiles that include personal details and account information for both sender and receiver and upload them.<br/>
During each transaction, the system verifies your identity by matching your fingerprint image with those stored in database.<br/>
For added security, every transaction requires a temporary password, and a unique 16-digit number is generated. This dual authentication process guarantees that your money transfers are safe and secure.
